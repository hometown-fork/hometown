# Queer Haus Hometown

This is a fork of [Hometown](https://github.com/hometown-fork/hometown) which is a fork of [Mastodon](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon).

This repo is not intended to be used by others as it contains specific changes to our instance. 
We try to contribute back to the upstream projects whenever we can.


## Local development environment

Mastodon comes with a preconfigured local environment using vagrant. You have to install Vagrant and Virtualbox on your machine for it to work.

An admin account with the e-mail `admin@mastodon.local` and password `mastodonadmin` is created automatically during setup. Use that to login.
